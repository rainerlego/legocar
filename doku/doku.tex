\section{Overview}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/architecture}
\caption{Architecture overview}
\label{figarchitecture}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The general architecture of our project is shown in Figure~\ref{figarchitecture}.
The FPGA plays the central role:
It controls the Servo/Motor-controller board and reads the sensor inputs.
In future it can also be connected to a camera.
Due to the limited time we could not implement the camera interface.
The FPGA is also responsible for calculating the current speed based on the sensor inputs and for controlling the motor acceleration.

All the high-level communication is done by the RaspberryPi, which is connected to the FPGA.
It receives steering commands from mobile phones, notebooks or Wiimotes and passes them to the FPGA.
The Raspi creates an Wifi access point and has a bluetooth interface.
This way, any Wifi and TCP/IP capable device as well as Wiimote controllers can control the car.

Besides the real hardware, there exists a software simulator for the car.
It has the same interface as the RaspberryPi and can be used to simulate steering algorithms.
It is possible for the Raspi software to send the control commands to the simulation program via TCP/IP instead of the real hardware.


Figure~\ref{figcaroverview} shows, how the above mentioned architecture is realized on the car. All the components are mounted on a wooden plate on top of the car.

\section{Powerboard}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very early in this project, we noticed, that supplying the various boards and modules on the car with power becomes a problem.
This is why we designed a simple board to distribute the power among all components.
The board also has a central on-off switch for all of the needed voltages.
Two LEDs show, if the 5V and 12V voltages are supplied.
The schematics are very simple an can be seen in Figure \ref{figpowerboardscm}. Figure \ref{figpowerboardr} shows the finished board.

\section{Rotary Encoders} \label{sensors}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To measure speed, we built two rotary encoders into the car.
They are based on a simple and cheap light barrier with an included Schmitt trigger and a rotary encoder disc.
A picture and a schematic of the light barriers can be seen in Figure \ref{figls}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{pic/ls.png}
\caption{Light barrier}
\label{figls}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The rotary encoders are built by having a rotating disc with alternating opaque and non-opaque slots in the light barrier's light sensing gap.
There are four slots in each disc, so that we can measure the speed at the resolution of roughly eight edges per turn, because we measure the falling as well as the rising edges.
The discs are mounted on shafts, which are directly connected to the differentials.
We use two rotary encoders.
One is connected to the front differential and one is connected to the back differential.
The cardan shaft of the initial 4WD car design has been removed to make room for the rotary encoders.
Because of the removed 4WD and the two rotary encoders, it is now possible to measure the speed of the front and the back wheels independently.
This enables us to detect slippage, as only the back wheels are driven by the motor.
A traction control system (TCS) is implemented in hardware in the FPGA with the help of this feature.

Figure \ref{figencmount1} shows the aluminium component that has been manufactured to hold the front rotary encoder shaft in place.
Figures \ref{figencmount2} and \ref{figencmount3} show, how the rotary encoder discs are mounted on the car.

\end{figure}


To connect the light barriers to the FPGA, we built a Sensorboard. It has the task to supply the light barriers with power and to convert the output voltage of the light barriers to the right level.
One transistor for each light barrier was used for this task.
There are also two LEDs on the board, that show the current state of the light barriers.
This made it easier to debug the light barriers when moving the rotary encoder discs into position.
The schematics of the Sensorboard can be seen in Figure \ref{figsensorboardscm}. The board layout and a 3D rendering can be seen in Figures \ref{figsensorboardbrd} and \ref{figsensorboard3d}.

\subsection{Schematics}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/servoboard}
\caption{Servoboard schematics}
\label{figservoboardscm}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figservoboardscm} shows the schematics of our Servoboard.
There are three debug LEDs and one power LED.
The board is powered via a standard 5V voltage regulator.
We added a programming socket to the board, so that the microcontroller does not have to be removed while flashing, but can be programmed onboard.
The 12Mhz crystal oszillator is needed, because the internal atmega8 oscillator only has a frequency of 8Mhz and is not as precise as the external 12MHz oszillator.
The servos are controlled via a signal similar to PWM, where the length of a pulse determines the actual position.
Therefore accurate timing is necessary.

The Servoboard can control up to 8 servos simultaneously.
The signal line of each servo is directly connected to a separate microcontroller output pin.
The servos are powered via an external power source.
The supply voltage of each servo is denoised by a separate capacitor.
They are however not grounded directly, but via a mosfet, that is controlled by the microcontroller.
This is because of the following:
During microcontroller startup, the servo signals are not stable and might infer some unwanted movements of the servos.
Switching the servo power supply via the microcontroller enables us to boot up the microcontroller, apply the corresponding signals to the servo control lines and then, after the signals are stable, enable the servos.
This way, it is made sure, that always the correct signals are applied to the servos.
The servo power supply mosfet can be circumvented by a jumper, which is positioned next to the mosfet.

\subsection{Board}
After the schematics have been created, the PCB board layout was designed.
The components are placed on the board and connected with the corresponding copper tracks.
This process is also called routing.
Routing wasn't a big problem, as we had enough room on the board.
Almost all tracks fitted on one layer and only a few vias and additional floating wires were needed.
This made the PCB manufacturing process easier, as only a one-sided PCB could be used.
Figure \ref{figservoboardbrd} shows the finished board layout, Figure \ref{figservoboard3d} shows a 3D rendering of the Servoboard and the finished board can be seen in Figure \ref{figservoboardr}.

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Servoboard}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Communication protocol}
The Servoboard is connected via the I2C or two-wire interface to a command unit.
The command unit can either be the FPGA or the RaspberryPi.


The I2C protocol is not implemented in software, but the hardware I2C capabilities of the AVR Atmega8 microcontroller are used.
This gives us faster response time and less overhead.
It also unburdens the AVR CPU, as only one hardware interrupt is needed, each time a complete byte is received via I2C.
Implementing I2C via software would have required many timer interrupts and might have turned out less stable.


We implemented our own communication protocol on top of I2C.
In the microcontroller's firmware, we used a simple state machine to realize this.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{pic/servoboardcmds}
\caption{Servoboard communication protocol}
\label{figservoboardcmds}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The communication protocol is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figservoboardcmds} looks as follows:
The Master first sends a preamble (0xff), which is used to synchronize both communication partners.
This is necessary, because loosing packets or receiving corrupted data can lead to a situation, where the receiving unit ends up in an undefined or faulty state.
Therefore, it might be that the communication gets stuck.

By sending a preamble, which cannot be part of the normal communication, this problem is solved: Every time the microcontroller receives a preamble-byte, the communication state machine goes back to its initial state, no matter what the current state is.
This way, if a transmission error occurs, only the current command is lost, but further communication will still be possible.


Nevertheless, our communication protocol makes it possible to transmit 0xff inside a command using the following method:
If values greater or equal than 254 are sent, they are split into two bytes.
The first byte is 254 and the next one is the difference to the desired number.
On the receiver's side, both values are then combined and their sum determines the actual number. 
For example if 255 needs to be sent, the two bytes 254 and 1 are sent.


After the preamble has been sent, the controlling device sends the command byte to the Servoboard.
The command byte is split into two sections:
The four MSBs make up the command and the four LSBs can carry an additional parameter.
This makes it possible to send only one byte for small commands.

The following commands are the most important commands to control the Servoboard:
\begin{description}
\item[CMD\_SERVO] This command sets the position of a certain servo. The servo id (0-7) is sent in the 4 lower bits of the command byte. Then comes the high byte of the servo's target position followed by the lower byte of the target position. The servo position is passed via an unsigned value from 0 to 8000. 0 means complete left position, 4000 means zero position and 8000 means complete right position.

\item[CMD\_SERVO10] This command enables or disable all of the servo's power supply by switching the power supply mosfet on the PCB on or off. The value off(0) or on(1) is given via the lower 4 bits of the command byte.

\item[CMD\_LED] Sets the three LEDs on the Servoboard. The MSB of the command byte states, if the LEDs are switched on(1) or off(0). The lower three bits are a mask for the LEDs: Only the ones, where the bit is set to 1 in the mask are switched.

\end{description}

\subsection{Firmware}
Servos are controlled as follows: 
In a 20ms time interval, the signal line is always low except one short pulse of 1ms to 2ms.
The length of the pulse determines the position of the servo:
Left(1ms), zero position(1.5ms) or right(2ms).
This pulse is repeated every 20ms.
To drive those signals, the Servoboard firmware only uses one 16bit timer and a corresponding compare match interrupt.
The eight pulses for the eight servos are generated in series: The current servo's signal line is set to 1 and the 16bit timer is configured to give a compare match interrupt in the exact time of the pulse for this servo.
When this compare match interrupt occurs, the line for the current servo is set back to zero and the pulse for the next servo is generated in the same way.
After all 8 servo pulses are generated, the Seroboard will wait (with the help of timers of course) the rest of the 20ms and then start again to generate the 8 pulses.

Even if this method generates the pulses via software, it does not have much overhead or stress the CPU.
There is not much to calculate and all the work is done in compare match interrupts.
The timing is generated by the hardware 16bit counter and not via software.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{RaspberryPi}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The RaspberryPi is used for highlevel communication.
It is connected to a wifi module via USB and opens up an access point.
The RasPi is also equipped with a bluetooth module to communicate with a Wiimote controller.

\subsection{Software}
On the RaspberryPi, there runs the raspi.exe program, which can be found in the \textit{raspi} folder.
It will start up a TCP/IP server and listen for a Wiimote controller via bluetooth.
Over those interfaces, it will accept highlevel commands to control the car.
Note that only one device is able to control the car at a time.
There is a handover mechanism implemented in the \textit{raspi.exe} program: If a device sends a \textit{getperm}-command, it will take over the control and commands from other currently connected devices are ignored.


The configuration of the raspi.exe program is done via the file \textit{config.h}:
SERVO\_M defines, to which module the RasPi software will send its commands. The possible values are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{SERVO\_SIM}
\item{SERVO\_BOARD}
\item{SERVO\_FPGA}
\end{itemize}

If SERVO\_SIM is set, \textit{raspi.exe} will send the commands to a simulation program via TCP/IP.
The IP and TCP port of the simulation program can also be configured in the \textit{config.h} file.
The \textit{raspi.exe} will send its commands directly to the Servoboard via I2C, if SERVO\_M is set to SERVO\_BOARD.
The last option SERVO\_FPGA causes \textit{raspi.exe} to talk to the FPGA board via SPI.

If a Wiimote controller should be used to control the car, WII\_ENABLED must be set to 1 in the \textit{config.h} file.
Communication via TCP/IP is always enabled.

Settings, which are more specific to one communication unit, can be configured in \textit{servoboard.h, servosim.h} or \textit{fpga\_spi.h} respectively. Those files contain the parameters for the I2C or SPI specific communication, such as addresses, speeds or the paths to the chardevs.

\subsection{TCP communication protocol}
The \textit{raspi.exe} TCP server accepts the following commands:
\begin{description}
\item[servo set $<$channel$>$ $<$valve$>$] Sets the servo which is connected on PIN $<$channel$>$ to the corresponding value. $<$channel$>$ must be an integer between 0 and 7. $<$value$>$ is also an integer. It can have values from 0 to 8000, where 4000 would mean the zero position.
\item[servo led $<$onoff$>$ $<$mask$>$] Sets the LEDs on the Servoboard. $<$onoff$>$ decides, whether the LEDs should be switched on(1) or off(0). The three LSBs of $<$mask$>$ decide, which LEDs should be switched. Only LEDs, where the bit in the mask is set to 1 will be switched on or off. For example, if one wants to enable the first and the third LED, one would send the command \textit{'servo led 1 5'}. Note that most of the LEDs are by default also used by the Servoboard firmware to signal various events. Once a LED has been manually set to a certain state by setting a bit to one in $<$mask$>$, this LED will not be used by the firmware anymore.
\item[servo getperm] This command initiates an control handover to the device, which is sending this command. From now on, \textit{raspi.exe} will only accept control commands from this device. All other currently connected devices will be ignored.

\item[speedacc $<$acc|speed$>$] This command switches between speed and acceleration based driving mode. If the speed mode is activated, the speed\_controller in the FPGA takes over control over the motor acceleration and tries to hold the car's speed at a certain value.

\item[as $<$on|off$>$] Enables/disables the traction control system (TCS). The TCS is built into the speed\_controller and tries to minimize the slipping of the drive wheels.

\item[speedraw $<$speed$>$] Sets the target speed for the speed\_controller. If the speed driving mode in enabled, the speed\_controller will try to drive the car at this speed.

\end{description}

\subsection{Remote control devices}
The car can be controlled by any device that supports TCP/IP over wifi.
So for example it is possible to control the car via a notebook that is connected to the car's wifi access point.
To demonstrate the remote control capabilities of the car's software, we implemented an Android client. Screenshots of this client can be seen in Figures \ref{figand1} and \ref{figand2}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.7\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pic/figand1.png}
    \caption{Control}

  \end{subfigure}~
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.3\textwidth}

    \caption{Settings}
		\label{figand2}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Android remote control client}
\end{figure}

Another option is to use a Wiimote remote to control the car. If the WII\_ENABLED option is set in the \textit{raspi.exe} configuration, the RaspberryPi software will periodically try to connect to a Wiimote controller.
Button 1 and 2 need to be pressed simultaneously on the Wiimote controller to enter the discovery procedure.
Once the Wiimote remote is connected to the RaspberryPi, the car can be controlled.
The Wiimote has the following key assignment:
\begin{description}
\item[+] Accquire control over the car (initiate handover mechanism)
\item[-] Enable/disable traction control system (only active in speed control mode)
\item[Home] Switch between speed control mode and acceleration mode
\item[A] Switch acceleration mode from \textit{button} to \textit{tilt} and vice-versa
\item[1] Accelerate slowly
\item[1+2] Accelerate
\item[2] Accelerate fast
\item[left] Accelerate backwards
\item[tilt left/right] Steer left/right
\item[tilt forward/backward] Accelerate forward/backward
\end{description}

\subsection{Overview}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pic/fpga}
\caption{FPGA overview}
\label{figfpga}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figfpga} shows a simplified overview of the architecture, we implemented in the FPGA.
The four SPI signals from the RaspberryPi are connected to the spislave unit, which implements a SPI slave reader/writer.
If the chip select signal (spi\_cs) is pulled to ground, spislave will read one byte, send one byte back and trigger a short pulse, when the transmission is complete.
The short pulse signals the spireader unit, that one byte has successfully transmitted and received.


Spislave is part of spireader, which implements a state machine to interpret the commands sent via the SPI interface.
According to the sent commands, spireader controls all the other units in the FPGA such as the speed\_control, speed-acceleration-mode-switch or servo controller.
spireader is also able to send back data to the RasPi, if requested. This feature is used to send the current front and rear speed as well as target speed and current acceleration to the RasPi for data logging and evaluation purposes.

The pulse signal lines from the light barriers are connected to a speed sensor unit which converts the falling and rising edges to a speed value.

The speed control unit, which is described in more detail in Section~\ref{speed}, takes the speed measurements from the speed sensors as well as target speed and configuration signals from the spireader.
The acceleration output of the speed control unit and the spireader unit are connected to the two inputs of the speed-acceleration-mode-switch.
The speed-acceleration-mode-switch also has a switch input signal, which determines the output of the switch. This unit is used to select between acceleration based driving mode and speed based driving mode. Based on the switch input signal, either the acceleration output of the speed control unit or the direct acceleration value of the spireader is forwarded to the servo controller unit.

The servo controller unit implements a state machine to send servo commands via I2C to our Servoboard.
It takes care of sending the preambles, commands and parameters.
To do this, it has to apply the right signals at the right time throughout the whole I2C transaction.
After a transaction is complete, or an error occurs, the servo controller state machine will go back to its initial reset state.



\subsection{Speed control} \label{speed}
We designed the VHDL \emph{speed\_control} architecture to convert a desired speed received from the upper level logic into a supply current for the car's engine. To achieve best possible accuracy the meassured speed on each axis, as well as the desired speed are processed, depending on the operating mode. In the following the two operating modes \emph{Simple speed regulation} and \emph{traction control} are described and evaluated in detail.
\subsubsection{Simple speed regulator} \label{simplepi}
In this mode the \emph{speed\_control} unit tries to reach the desired speed $v_{dest}$ by directly regulating the rear wheel to the desired speed, assuming, that the speed of this wheel is the speed of the car.\\
The speed regulation is done by implementing a PI-Regulator. The regulator interval is $\frac{1}{10}s$. Every timestep the difference between desired and current wheel speed is calculated:
$$\Delta = v_{dest} - v_{rear}$$
The calculated difference is then summed up to implement the integral part of the regulator:
$$\Delta_{sum} += \Delta$$
The output power to the engine calculates as follows:
$$power = c_P \cdot \Delta + c_I \cdot \Delta_{sum}$$
Thereby $c_P$ and $c_I$ are constant parameters and need to be tuned to achieve optimum behaviour. $c_P$ configures the proportional part of the regulator. The higher the value, the faster the response of the regulator. But too high values make the system unstable. The constant $c_I$ is responsible for the integral part of the regulator, which stabilizes the regulator by allowing it to converge to a steady output power level.\\
The initial values for $c_P$ and $c_I$ were calculated to allow the speed to reach a stable state within 1 to 2 seconds after a major change of the desired speed. These current values are far from optimum, because our calculations did not consider the complex reactions of the car. Hence for optimum performance, the regulator needs to be tuned by doing experimental measurements. In figure \ref{figand2} a typical regulator response to a change in desired speed can be seen.

\subsubsection{Traction control}
Traction control mode can be activated by applying a logic 1 level to the \emph{enable\_antischlupf} input. In this mode the regulator tries to prevent the rear wheels from slipping during the acceleration phase, which is especially useful for driving on surfaces with low friction or trying to accelerate as quickly as possible. To achieve this, we used two speed sensors: One for the rear axis and one for the front axis, as described in chapter \ref{sensors}. The read out speeds $v_{front}$ and $v_{rear}$ from these sensors as well as the desired speed $v_{dest}$ are provided to \emph{speed\_control} and the output power to the engine is calculated by modifying the PI-regulator described in section \ref{simplepi} as follows.\\
In each regulating step the difference between the front and rear wheel is calculated:
$$slip = c_S \cdot (v_{front} - v_{rear})$$
where $c_S$ is a constant to configure the response to slipping. To allow a certain speed difference (about 8\% speed difference between front and rear wheel should be fine) $slip$ is modified:
$$\text{if }slip>=-2\cdot c_S \text{ then }  slip = 0$$
The $\Delta$ value for the modified PI regulator then results to
$$\Delta = v_{dest} - v_{rear} + slip$$
The rest of the regulator is implemented as described in section \ref{simplepi}. In figure \ref{figblub22} we compared the two regulators (traction control on and traction control off) when accelerating to top speed. It is clearly visible, that our traction control regulator improves rear wheel slipping behavior by closing the gap between rear and front wheel speed. We also experienced positive behavior when driving around corners at high speed. In this case the regulator prevents the rear wheels from breaking out by reducing the wheelspeed and hence increasing grip. Please note, that the regulator constants still need to be tuned to reach better performance. The current implementation should be seen as a proof of concept.

\section{Simulator}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To debug steering algorithms and high level communication protocols, we implemented a simple car simulator.
After staring up the simulator, the car can be driven via the arrow keys. When pressing \textit{C}, one can delegate the control to the built-in TCP server. The current state is shown in the upper left corner.
When the control mode is switched to \textit{TCP}, the simulator accepts commands via TCP/IP.
The TCP/IP interface accepts the same commands as the Servoboard.
In this way, the RaspberryPi can be attached to the simulator instead of the real car.
Also, the simulator does not have to run on the same machine as the control software.
So for example, the RaspberryPi can be mounted on the car, but for testing purposes send the commands to the simulator instead of the Servoboard.

In addition to a very simple physical driving model, the simulator also simulates the output, which would be given by our concept of a laser scanner. This output can be seen in the rectangle in the top of the simulator window. The red lines in front of the car depict the viewing angle of the camera, which is used for the laser scanner.

A screenshot of the simulator can be seen in Figure \ref{figsim}.

\section{Lessons learned}
\subsection{Hardware design}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Using jumper wires is very useful for debugging electronics, because it is possible to frequently change the system and swap modules.
  \item Designing our boards with redundant connectors for connecting copper wires, as well as connecting jumper wires proved as very useful, because it was possible to easily connect additional debugging hardware, like an oscilloscope or a protocol analyzer in paralel to existing connections.
  \item For debugging communication protocols like i2c and spi a digital storage oscilloscope was extremely helpful.
  \item When debugging timing critical logic, it is useful to connect additional signals from the logic to physical FPGA pins as debugging pins and also connect them to an additional oscilloscope channel.
  \item It took us one week to find a bug in our spi protocol implementation, which was caused by noise when switching from a high to a low level on the clock provided by the RasPi (see figure \ref{fignoise}). The debug pin method described above helped us to locate the problem. The green signal in the oscilloscope screenshot represents the debugging pin, which was connected to a signal which toggles it's value at each detected falling clock edge.

	\item The seven segment displays on the FPGA board proved very useful for debugging. Only few lines of code are needed to control them and it is very easy to display FPGA internal signal values on them.
  \item For debugging hardware with complex behavior like the speed regulator, is was very useful to use the already running SPI communication to send live data streams back to our computers for analysis. Some of this data can be seen in section \ref{speed}.

\subsection{Safety}
Robots are dangerous! If you make an error in motor control logic engines can start and stop unexpected. During the development and testing of the car we were injured several times, because the car drove by its own and we could not control it. One time our car almost fell of the 3rd story of the university building, which would possibly have caused serious health risk for people walking downstairs. This incident was caused by an interference of the wifi signal we used to control the car with the university wifi network. After the signal was lost our car tried to drive according to the last command which was sent: Full speed and steering in the left direction. After this incident we agreed on several rules when testing the robot:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement a timeout in the Servoboard. This ensures a engine stop and steering reset as soon as no signal arrives for a period of 0.2 seconds. This effectively prevented the car from getting out of control due to a lost signal in the future.
  \item Do not test the car in a dangerous environment like on a bridge or high grounds.
  \item Do not test the robot alone. At least one person should always run along with the car to catch it if something goes wrong.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}
We originally planned on building our own low cost laser scanner. We did some calculations and realized a complete laser scanner system could be achieved with a measurement interval of up to 50 complete captures per second utilizing the FPGA for data analysis at an accuracy of better than $\pm10cm$ in a range of 6 meters (see figure \ref{figlaser2}). Figure \ref{figlaser} shows the general concept of the scanner: A line laser  is mounted on the car and projects a laser line parallel to the ground onto possible obstacles. A camera is mounted on top of the car at a height of about $30cm$ and captures the reflected laser light. The distance of all obstacles in front of the car can then be calculated by splitting the camera image into columns. The column number of a detected red pixel determines the angular position of the obstacle and the row number gives the distance.

\label{figlaser}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The position x of the obstacle can be calculated using the camera pixel value y:
$$x = tan(y\cdot a+b)\cdot h$$
Due to the limited time we were not able to finish the scanner, but we already ordered a laser, built a mounting clamp on the car for the laser and made simple tests as a proof of concept.
